# Study-Spot

Study-Spot is a MERN application created for students who are looking for places study. I developed this app after I organized the study group sessions for my web development bootcamp class. Websites such as Yelp and Google did not provide sufficient information regarding outlets,wifi,noise level and other factors I considered conducive to a successful study outing. The great thing about Study-Spot is if a spot you know of doesn't exist on the site, you can just add it yourself without even having to register. 

Study-Spot is user-friendly, free to use application with a polished UI.
