# Study Spot

Study Spot is a MERN application created for students who are looking for places to study. I developed this app after I organized the study group sessions for my web development bootcamp. Websites such as Yelp and Google did not provide sufficient information regarding outlets, wifi, noise level, and other factors I considered conducive to a successful study outing. The great thing about Study Spot is if a spot you know of doesn't exist on the site, you can just add it yourself. 

Study Spot is a user-friendly, free to use application with a polished UI.
